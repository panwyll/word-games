  # ── Job 1: Build ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # This job mirrors the Vercel build exactly (npm ci → lint → type-check →
  # next build).  It is intentionally kept separate so it can be set as a
  # *required status check* in branch-protection settings, ensuring no PR can
  # be reviewed or merged until the build is green.

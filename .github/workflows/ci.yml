# The build gate is enforced by the real Vercel deployment check, which the
# Vercel GitHub app posts on every PR commit.  Set "Vercel" (or the deployment
# check name shown in your PR) as a *required status check* in
# Settings → Branches → Branch protection rules.
#
# This workflow only runs the E2E test suite, which builds the app itself via
# the Playwright webServer config.
